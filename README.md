# GitHub Stats 
Unlock Insights from GitHub Data

GitHub Stats is a GitHub API Service built as a web app using Python and Flask framework. It helps users generate insights and analytics based on their GitHub activity, such as commit history, repository statistics, and contribution metrics. This is a portfolio project for the *Software Engineering* programme at *ALX* which marks the end of the foundation curriculum.

## Action
The user inputs their GitHub profile (username) and the service generates insights and analytics for that user.

## Python
I am familiar with Python and I wanted to get more technical by using Python for web development, data visualization, and consuming APIs. During this project, I became more familiar with the Flask framework, Matplotlib library, and MySQL database.

## The Goal 
The goal for this project was to write better code, get more familiarized with Python, its framework, and libraries, and provide a fantastic data-rich and logged-out experience for users. GitHub API was great for data retrieval, Flask was used for both the frontend and backend, Matplotlib was used for data visualization, and MySQL was utilized as the database.

## The look
I used a simple but inferential (tells the user what the service does) logo. I used Semantic UI to make the design responsive so that I could focus more on the technical side of things.

## The Logged out experience  
The service's functionality (core experience) is exposed completely to the user with no requirement for login as long as a GitHub username is provided. There is no need to log in because there is no additional information the user could provide to alter the experience.

## Collaboration
Although I worked alone on the project, I received valuable feedback from peers and technical mentors. This included code reviews and suggestions for improving error handling and database interactions. I also consulted online resources like Stack Overflow, Flask documentation, ChatGPT, and GitHub community discussions to troubleshoot issues and refine the project.
